## Project Structure and Folders

Organize your documentation into a tree-like structure. Create folders to group related pages, making navigation intuitive.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Project Root] --> B[Docs]
    A --> C[API]
    B --> D[Introduction]
    B --> E[Guides]
    C --> F[Endpoints]
    C --> G[Authentication]
```

Nest folders as deeply as needed. Drag and drop to reorder pages.

  <Tab title="Public Sharing" icon="globe">
